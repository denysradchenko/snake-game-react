The game concept is attempts to eat apples by running into them with the head of the snake. Each item eaten makes the snake longer, so controlling is progressively more difficult.

The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border or itself.

To control snake movements use arrow keys on Your keyboard:
- Arrow Up
- Arrow Down
- Arrow Left
- Arrow Right
